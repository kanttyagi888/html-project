          About the legend
        </h1>
        <p>
           ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
          was born on October 15, 1931, in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
          ☛ He served as the 11th President
          of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
          ☛ Kalam earned a degree in
          aeronautical engineering from the
          Madras Institute of Technology and in
          1958 joined the Defence Research and
          Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
          ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
          Space Research Organisation, where he
          was project director of the SLV-III, the
          first satellite launch vehicle that was
          both designed and produced in India.
          <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
          Kalam planned the program that produced
          a number of successful missiles, which
          helped earn him the nickname <strong>
              “Missile Man.”</strong>
          <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
          was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
          ballistic missile, which incorporated
          aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
          in 1989.
